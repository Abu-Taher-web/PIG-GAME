# PIG GAME

## Description
PIG GAME is a simple, two-player dice game developed during the 2nd year of my bachelorâ€™s degree. The game involves two buttons: "ROLL DICE" and "HOLD". Players take turns rolling the dice. A player can roll the dice multiple times, but if they roll a 1, they lose their turn and all points for that round. Players can hold to save their score and pass the turn to the next player.

## How to Install or Run
To run the game, follow these steps:
1. Download or clone the repository to your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abu-Taher-web/PIG-GAME.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to play the game.
